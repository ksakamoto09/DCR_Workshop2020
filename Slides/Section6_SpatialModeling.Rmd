# Spatial Autocorrelation

## Spatial Autocorrelation

Tobler's first law of geography."everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."    

To model spatial data, similar to time lags, spatial lags can be created. 

- spatial lags:  is a variable that averages the neighboring values of a location.

## Goals of Autocorrelation

To measure and give a more objective measure of autocorrelation.

We can visually see when things are clustered, but to what degree? Can
we reject the null hypothesis(CSR)?

## Spatial Weights Matrix

we need to first capture the spatial relationship between all pairs of locations. The spatial
weights matrix allows us to do this. 
```{r spww, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Youyi_Bi/publication/327776659/figure/fig1/AS:672948855791617@1537454918147/A-typical-spatial-weights-matrix-Note-that-A-and-E-do-not-share-a-side-thus-their.png")
```

<div class="notes">
the first row is the first feature with it's relationship against every other feature.

here we are using adjacency.
</div>

## Contiguity Relationships

We can model neighbors through contiguity.

```{r neighbors, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/edc8bde1bba660f775d8a7d50b91fe24ed1a96c9/5-Figure3-1.png")
```

## Distance Relationships

We can also model neighbors through distances.

Inverse Distance, Distance Band, Zone of Indifference, K-nearest Neighbor, etc...

```{r distances, echo=FALSE,  fig.show = "hold", out.width = "25%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/GUID-EA90AD1C-E27D-489A-9803-2D684A0CF93E-web.gif")

knitr::include_graphics("https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/GUID-EC3950E7-1898-4B58-B47D-43387994849E-web.gif")

```

## spdep

in R the `spdep` pacakge is used to create spatial weights matrix objects from
polygon contiguities. A collection of functions to measure spatial autocorrelation
is also included. For example, Moran's I, Geary's C, Getis/Ord G.

## Spatial Weights Matrix

The spatial weights themselves won't be insightful!

they are just conceptualizations of the spatial relationships you choose, which
can be used as a hypothesis of the underlying relationship materialized as a matrix.

If the process is not well understood, creating a useful spatial weights matrix
will be difficult. Starting with a simple adjacency matrix is a good idea if so.

## Moran's I

Moran's I is by far the most utilized autocorrelation measure. 

Here is the equation for Moran's I:

$$I = \frac N W  \frac {\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}(x_i-\bar x) (x_j-\bar x)} {\sum_i (x_i-\bar x)^2} $$
where $N$ is the number of spatial units indexed by $i$ and $j$; $x$ is the variable of interest; $\bar{x}$ is the mean of $x$;$w_{ij}$ is a matrix of spatial weights with zeroes on the diagonal (i.e., $w_{ii}=0$); and $W$ is the sum of all $w_{ij}$.^[[Moran's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I)]

<div class="notes">
basically covariance / total variance. 

values will be -1 to 1
</div>


## Moran's I Diagnostics

Moran's I is effectively the correlation coefficient for the relationship 
between the attribute values and the local mean attribute.

```{r MoransIDiagnostics, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/img/MoranI_scatter_plot.png")
```

## Monte Carlo Simulation

By scrambling the attribute values on the map,
we can calculate an expected p value. 

This is a method of empirical deriving a sampling distribution. 

```{r montecarloMorans, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="not exactly like this...", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b5/united_states_map.png")
```

## Moran's I Spatial lag

plotting Moran's I against number of lags can show the degree of autocorrelation across space.
In this example, you can see the degree of autocorrelation is decreasing with distance.
At some point, there's even no correlation. 

```{r spatialLags, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/img/MoranI_distance_band.png")
```

# Local Statistics

## Local Statistics

Local Statistics is a fairly recent innovation in spatial analysis. Many previous techniques(global statistics) can be 
utilized on a subset of the study area. A localized mean is the key to many of 
these methods. 

The computational power needed to calculate Monte Carlo simulations for localized patterns
has only recently made this area practical.   

<div class="notes">
Global didn't say where things were happening
local can
</div>

## What is Local?

A row from the spatial weight matrix could be defined as a neighborhood. 

But local cab be defined with adjacency, distance, or other rule based neighborhoods.

Different conceptual models will deliver different results! 

<div class="notes">
If it's transportation related, maybe connect train lines?
</div>

## Getis-Ord Methods

The Getis-Ord methods of local statistics which include the Gi* and Gi
are able to detect high or low value concentrations.

## Getis-Ord Methods cont.

$$G_i = \frac{\sum_{j \neq i} w_{ij} x_j}{\sum_{j \neq i} x_j}$$

$$G_i^* = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij} x_j}{\sum_j x_j}$$

The $G_i$ stat is simply the proportion of the sum of all $x$ values in the study 
area accounted for by just the neighbors of $i$. 
If neighbors are high valued, the $G_i$ will be relatively high, and conversely for low values. 
The $G_i^*$ stat includes the $x_i$ feature too.

<div class="notes">
the main difference is that the gi doesn't have the x_i or the feature
in it's calculation compared to the gi*.

the values of Gi are dependent on the ration of two sums of x values so adding a constant to every value or taking the log
will change the results.
</div>

## Other Points

The Getis Ord methods only work with positive values. 

Say you are working with binary outcomes, or positive values less than 1, then the 
resulting General G will also be between 0 and 1.

## Findings

You'll see that the area with the highest neighbors now will have a higher values. 

You'll also have to be careful looking at z-score values since local statistics are calculated
with few data points. we can increase the number, but then they won't be as "local"!

```{r getisordgi, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-statistics-toolbox/GUID-CD4A0DC7-205E-46CC-8C3D-558A1D48940C-web.png")
```

<div class="notes">
again higher z-scores mean that the area has a higher average than the mean

often gi* and gi give the same results.
</div>

## Local Moran's I

Similar to GLobal Moran's I, instead of summarizing over the whole data set, we can summarize over the locality of each data point. 

```{r localMoran, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-statistics-toolbox/GUID-203ADC3E-C9BC-4FF3-890F-B11B05F1FC41-web.png")
```


## Local Moran's Scatterplot

A scatter plot will show the high-high and low-low clusters, as well as outliers.

```{r localMoranScatter, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cristina_Gomez/publication/229346700/figure/fig4/AS:300773247340565@1448721338553/Morans-I-scatterplot-The-slope-of-the-regression-line-is-an-estimation-of-the-global.png")
```

## Inference of Local Stats

Since p values are very low in spatial statistics,
We could change the criteria for significance.

$$ a^` = 1 - (1 - a)^{1/n}$$

 with the Bonferroni correction

$$a^` = a/n$$ 

or use Monte Carlo simulation, where the value at the location of interest is held stable.(conditional permutation)


## Normal Regression

Coefficients are set for all locations. (variables are independent)
Predictors shouldn't be highly correlated (multicollineraity)
dependent variables should be normally distributed. 

You can always check residuals by mapping them. 

If any trend is detected it's *misspecified*.

<div class="notes">
In spatial world, this implies that spatial dependence of the variables should be
included in the model. or
it may be reasonable to allow the model to vary spatially.
</div>

## Spatial Lag Model

If there seems to be autocorrelation in your normal OLS model, you might want to include
spatially lagged variables. you can do that with the `lagsarlm` function.

You can use the spatial weights matrix from before to include the spatial lags in your regression.

<div class="notes">

</div>

## Geographically Weighted Regressions

Allows regression coefficients in model to vary from area to area. As variables change from places, so can their relationships. 

Instead of creating one large model, creating regional models might perform better. It is related to multi-level modeling. 

## Criticism

similar to other local statistics, inferences are made from regression coefficients that may not be statistically significant. Also the number of observations to be included may be small.

This is why inference might be dubious, but as a exploratory tool is useful.
