# Spatial Statistics

## Intro

Unlike traditional non-spatial statistical methods,
we incorporate space (proximity, area, connectivity, 
and/or other spatial relationships) directly into the mathematics.

There are **three** main types of spatial statistics: Geostatistics, 
Point Pattern Analysis, and Lattice Data Analysis. We'll focus on
the first two.

## sp land

We were previously working with sf objects, but we must revert back to sp objects
to utilize the functionality of these libraries.


## Geostatistics

Geostatistics are used for point observations that are continuously changing over regions. 

```{r geostats, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Semivariogram modeling winter temps", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/geostatistical-analyst/GUID-EC38C932-C716-4F2D-ACA4-2F7D659C9950-web.png")
```
<div class="notes">
You can think of natural phenomena like temperature, precipitation, geological features.
</div>

## Point Pattern Analysis

Discrete or countable observations occur across regions that can be analyzed. 

```{r pointPattern, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("https://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/pointpat2.jpg")
```

<div class="notes">
You can think of locations of trees, cases of asthma, and coffee shops on a block.
</div>

## The Case for Spatial Stats

Why is this field so exciting?  One factor has been a growing
awareness that data collected in space, like data collected over time, tend to exhibit
statistical dependence or spatial autocorrelation. 

[Tobler's First Law of Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography) states "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things".

# Point Pattern Analysis

## PPA

Spatial point pattern analysis uses the `spatstat` package primarily.

Examples:

- Locations of Street Trees
- Density of crimes 
- Clustering of Asthma
- Human Settlement Patterns

## PPA Terms

- **Events** are points where the location of event of interest all points are known no missing values
- **Spatial Process** how a spatial pattern might be generated
- **Spatial Pattern** a potential realization of a stochastic process
- **Complete Spatial Randomness** a stochastic process that can be mapped and derived or computed.  

## Applying Patterns

- to better understand the phenomena
- to monitor changing conditions
- to compare and contrast different features

## PPA Assumptions 

In PPA, the null hypothesis in PPA is complete spatial randomness(CSR), 
if you reject the null hypothesis a significant pattern may be at play.

```{r csr, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = "50%"}

```

## Seeing & Describing Patterns

Visually it's quiet easy to see patterns on a map...

But can we describe them quantitatively? and what are methods
of doing so?

## Centrography

The simplest method is Centrography. basically summary stats for spatial features

- Mean Center computed average X and Y values
- Standard Distance the variance average distance from features to mean center
- Standard Deviational Ellipse standard distances split into X and Y coordinates

## Centrography

```{r centrpgraphy, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/img/centrography.svg")
```

## Mean Center

```{r meanCenterCode, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mc <- input %>% st_union() %>% st_centroid()
```

```{r meanCenter, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-statistics-toolbox/GUID-1F7217DA-FC4E-46A2-B91C-7AB5E53DDA9C-web.gif")
```

## Standard Distance

```{r standardDistanceCode, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sdSF <- p %>% st_coordinates() %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    summarize(sd = sqrt(sum((X - mean(X))^2 + (Y - mean(Y))^2)/n()))

stanDist <- st_buffer(mc, dist = sdSF$sd)
```

```{r standardDistance, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-statistics-toolbox/GUID-8C3A2CCE-F93F-4036-8ADA-CB2FDF9DB45C-web.gif")
```

<div class="notes">
You can see that our standard distance is similar to one standard deviation. 68% of our data will be covered in from
the mean center.

</div>

# Density

## Global Density

if we look at the whole study area we can calculate the point density as 
$$\frac{n}{a}$$
where $n$ is the observed number of points and $a$ is the study region's area. For
instance if we had 10 schools in 100 acres, our point density is $$\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$$
so 0.1 schools per acre. 

## Local Density

We looked at global density, but what about point patterns that cane be measured 
across different locations within the study region?

We can then contrast if density is equally distributed across the region, 
or if there maybe an underlying local process at play.

<div class="notes">
What is a neighborhood? distance
</div>

## Quadrat Density

Quadrats or sub-divisions is a simple form of local density measurement.
Quadrats are are often squares, but many other
shapes such as hexagons and triangles can be implored. 

- What other shapes/tiling options could there be?
- What properties would be beneficial?

## Quadrat Density

We can first create a 2x2 quadrat using the `quadratcount` function which will divide
up our schools and count up the number of schools in each square.

```{r quadrat, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/11-Point-Patterns_files/figure-html/f11-quad01-1.png")
```

## Poisson Distribution

The proability distribution for a quadrat count of PPA is based off of the possion distribution. 

where $k$ is the event, $\lambda$ is the average intensity of the pattern per quadrant and $e$ is the bse of the natural 
logarithm. 

$$P(k)= \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$

## Poisson Distribution

To measure the fit of observed the distribution from a quadrat count, you can measure that the mean and variance are equal, called the *variance-mean ratio* and it should equal be 1, if the distribution is poisson. 

```{r poissonDist, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Poisson_pmf.svg/650px-Poisson_pmf.svg.png")
```

## Chi-Square

So for $K$ number of event in a quadrat, you can get the $O$ observed number of quadrats and the $E$ expected number from the poisson probability. 

Once you have the $O$, Poisson Probability, dervied $E$, a chi square number can be created. we expect values of 1, but larger figures can point to clustering (greater observations vs expected values).

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$$

* limitations, include small sample size with low mean intensity per quadrat. (issue with local stats)

## Quadrat Density

```{r quardratCode, echo=TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(maptools)
points <- tibble(X = runif(100),
                 Y = runif(100)) %>% 
    sp::SpatialPoints() %>% 
    as("ppp")

spatstat::quadratcount(points, nx = 2, ny = 2)
```

## Quadrat Nonuniform Geography

Quadrat areas don't have to be uniform like squares, they could
be created on a covariate like elevation, temperature, land uses, etc. or by creating a [tessellated surface](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Tessellation).

```{r quadrat2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/11-Point-Patterns_files/figure-html/f11-quad03-1.png")
```

<div class="notes">
Though there is a steep increase in density at the highest elevation range, this increase is not monotonic across all ranges of increasing elevation suggesting that density may not be explained by elevation alone.
</div>

## MAUP in Quadrat Density

The quadrat analysis is still susceptible to the MAUP!

```{r quadrat3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://gispopsci.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/MAUPZone1.gif")
```

## More Definitions

- First-Order effects the influence of external or environmental factors on process outcomes
- Second-Order effects the influence of process outcomes at one location on possible process outcomes at nearby location

## First-Order Effect

Elevation is a common first-order effect. You can see the effect of the tree line on a mountain.

```{r firstorder, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.stack.imgur.com/ogsav.jpg")
```
<div class="notes">
elevation
</div>


## Second-Order Effect

Some trees can create a second-order effect. Allelopathy is exhibited in trees such as the walnut
that prohibits the growth of other species through the excretion of posion from their roots. 

```{r secondorder, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://myeducationofagardener.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/allelopathy-manzanita.jpg")
```

## Non-Stationary

When the chances of events change over space, the process is non-stationary. ie. if 
even though we accept probabilistic placement, if things are stationary we expect the 
intensity to stay constant and not drift. 

To complicate things further, there are first-order stationarity and second-order stationarity.


<div class="notes">
No drift between space or interaction between events/observations. A single realization of a 
process is not sufficient in differentiating between the two.
</div>

## Kernel Density

The kernel density is a method for exploring density from sampled features. It isn't 
too different from the quadrat method since we are still calculating a local density,
but in the kernel method there is a moving window that defines what local means.

## Kernel

A circular search area is applied that determines the distance(standard distance) to 
search for sample locations to spread values around the
locations. Often the quartic kernel is used. 

```{r kernels, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Kernels.svg/2560px-Kernels.svg.png')
```


## 1D Kernel Density

Here is an example of a one dimensional kernel density estimation.

```{r kernel1D, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="1D Kernel Density", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Comparison_of_1D_histogram_and_KDE.png')
```

## Kernel Density
```{r kernel, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Kernel Density", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/11-Point-Patterns_files/figure-html/f11-kernel01-1.png')
```

you will see that the above plot is using a 3x3 grid as a search distance with equal weights assigned to the cells. Locations with only one observation will have a weight of $\frac{1}{9} = 0.11$ Each cell will have this number computed across the grid.

## Default Kernels

The default kernel can be the "Gaussian smoothing kernel"

$$(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}u^2}$$
or "Quartic (biweight)"

$$(u) = \frac{15}{16}(1-u^2)^2\ 1_{(|u|\leq1)}$$

# Distance

## Distance-Based Measures

So far we have seen density-based methods. but we can also look at proximity/distance
to calculate spatial statistics.

## What is a Distance?

- Euclidean Distance with Pythagors' theorem
- Manhattan Distance
- Traveled Distance
- Others???

## Average Nearest Neighbors

An average nearest neighbor (ANN) analysis measures the average distance from each point in the study area to its nearest point. 

The parameter k can take on any order neighbor (up to n-1 where n is the total number of points).

## Calculation

Average Nearest Neighbors Ratio:

$$ANN_{ratio}=\dfrac{ANN}{ANN_{expected}}$$
Average Nearest Neighbor Expected:

$$ANN_{Expected}=\dfrac{0.5}{\sqrt{n/A}} $$
<div class="notes">
our ratio is 0.5 which means that our locations are randomly distributed. 

If the index (average nearest neighbor ratio) is less than 1, the pattern exhibits clustering. If the index is greater than 1, the trend is toward dispersion.
</div>


## ANN
```{r ANNcluster, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Three different point patterns: a single cluster, a dual cluster and a randomly scattered pattern.", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/11-Point-Patterns_files/figure-html/f11-diff-patterns-1.png')
```

## ANN
```{r ANNcluster2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Three different ANN vs. neighbor order plots. The black ANN line is for the first point pattern (single cluster); the blue line is for the second point pattern (double cluster) and the red line is for the third point pattern.", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/11-Point-Patterns_files/figure-html/f11-diff-ANN-plots-1.png')
```

## Issues with Bounding Geometries

Do you see a problem here? Could different shapes encompassing the same point pattern have the same surface area? 
If so, shouldn't’t the shape of our study area be a parameter in our ANN analysis? 

```{r minBoundingGeo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Different conceptualizations of the minimmum bouding geometry", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/GUID-EFBA5DB8-A161-4FE1-B2CB-792B65DC1469-web.png')
```

## Monte Carlo Simulation

We can use the probability of random chance of events happening in our study space to
simulate over many iterations. Can experimentally derive statistical significance/empirical P value. 

```{r marbles, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://previews.123rf.com/images/kozzi/kozzi1301/kozzi130103327/17169982-close-up-image-of-throwing-assorted-marbles.jpg')
```

## PPA Critiques

- Geographic data sets are not samples
- geographic data are almost never random
- geographic data are not independent random (autocorrelation)
- $n$ is always large and results will be statistically significant
- Scientific significance matters more than statistical significance

<div class="notes">
-process-realization approach enables us to view geographic data as sample in a way
- geographic data are not random, but is it scientifically useful to analyze through a stochastic process
- we can develop better models than CSR
- n is often large not always
- scientific significance is important. that's why we need better theories. not just stats.

just testing CSR is boring. we'd like to test other null hypotheses
</div>

## Inhomogenous Poisson Process

```{r IPP, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="100%"}

```

<div class="notes">
